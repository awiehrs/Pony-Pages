    <p>Ponies are sweet. They have tiny little hooves that hold up their perfect little legs. On top of their legs are their fat little bodies. They have a mane, a tail, and an unusually large head with a mouth full of horribly disgusting rectangle teeth.
    But that's not all! They smell like grass, mud, and poop, too! <br>
    They can sometimes love to cuddle as well. But you must befriend them, first. Or else.....
